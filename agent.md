Using Binance Spot and Futures APIs for Statistical Arbitrage and Trend‑Following
Introduction

Binance operates one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges and provides public APIs for spot and derivatives (futures) trading. These APIs allow programmatic access to market data such as order books, trades and OHLCV candlesticks. They do not compute technical indicators; instead, you receive raw price and volume data from which you can derive indicators using a separate analysis library. For a quantitative trading strategy that combines long‑term trend‑following with short‑term statistical arbitrage, you will need to:

Retrieve high‑quality price series (OHLCV) and market statistics (funding rates, open interest, trader positioning) using the public endpoints.

Compute technical indicators (moving averages, momentum, volatility, RSI, etc.) locally using a technical analysis library.

Design logic that detects long‑term trends while exploiting short‑term mean‑reverting behaviours between correlated instruments.

This guide explains how to use the Binance spot and USDⓈ‑M (USDT‑margined) futures APIs to gather data for such a strategy. The examples emphasise Python because the python‑binance client or simple requests calls integrate easily with data‑science libraries.

General API information
Base endpoints and time units

Spot API base URL – https://api.binance.com. This endpoint hosts REST endpoints for spot trading and public market data. Binance also provides alternative domains (e.g., https://api1.binance.com) for high availability
developers.binance.com
.

Futures API base URL (USDⓈ‑M) – https://fapi.binance.com 
developers.binance.com
. A separate domain (https://dapi.binance.com) is used for COIN‑M futures
developers.binance.com
; this report focuses on USDⓈ‑M futures since they are more widely traded.

Data‑only endpoint – https://data-api.binance.vision replicates the market‑data endpoints for spot and futures without affecting your account’s request weight
developers.binance.com
. Use this when you need only historical market data and not account‑specific endpoints.

Time units – all timestamps are returned in milliseconds by default
developers.binance.com
. Some endpoints (e.g., spot klines) allow an optional timeZone parameter to change the origin of interval calculations (default 0/UTC)
developers.binance.com
. The server runs on UTC; convert to your local time zone (Europe/London) after retrieval.

Rate limits and request weights

Each REST endpoint has a weight representing how much of your request quota it consumes. The server returns headers like X‑MBX‑USED‑WEIGHT to show your current usage. For example, retrieving all tickers at once has higher weight than retrieving a single symbol
developers.binance.com
. If you continuously poll high‑weight endpoints, you risk being rate‑limited. To stay within limits:

Use the data-api.binance.vision domain for bulk historical data.

Cache results locally when possible (e.g., store OHLCV data in a database).

Combine multiple subscriptions using WebSockets (see below) instead of polling many REST endpoints.

Respect the recommended intervals and avoid sending more than 10 orders per second from a single IP.

Authentication and signatures

Public market‑data endpoints (order book, trades, klines, ticker stats) do not require authentication. Endpoints that affect your account (placing orders, retrieving balances) require an API key and secret, and the request must include a timestamp and an HMAC SHA‑256 signature. Since this report concentrates on data retrieval, we omit private endpoints, but you should store API keys securely and never hard‑code them in code repositories.

WebSocket streams

While REST endpoints are useful for historical data, WebSocket streams provide low‑latency updates. For spot, the base WebSocket endpoint is wss://stream.binance.com:9443. You can subscribe to one or more streams by sending a JSON message with "method":"SUBSCRIBE" and a list of stream names. The documentation notes:

Streams names follow the pattern <symbol>@aggTrade, <symbol>@depth, <symbol>@kline_<interval>, etc.

You can open individual streams (raw) or a combined stream (multiple streams in one connection) by specifying ?streams=stream1/stream2/...
developers.binance.com
.

Combined streams are limited to 10 streams; one IP can have up to 5 orders per second and a maximum of 300 stream subscriptions.

Ping every 3 minutes to keep the connection alive. If you miss a heartbeat or exceed rate limits, the server will disconnect.
developers.binance.com

For futures, the base stream is wss://fstream.binance.com/ws. Stream names are similar but include @markPrice (for mark price and funding rates) and @forceOrder (liquidation stream). Use WebSockets for latency‑sensitive data (e.g., to measure micro‑second price differences for arbitrage) and REST for historical backfills.

Computing technical indicators

Binance only provides raw price and volume data. Technical indicators must be computed locally. The Python library TA‑Lib (also pandas‑ta) is widely used for feature engineering from time‑series. It is built on Pandas and NumPy and implements momentum, volume, volatility and trend indicators
technical-analysis-library-in-python.readthedocs.io
. Examples include:

Moving Average (MA) – smoothing price series over a window (e.g., 20‑period). Useful for trend detection.

Relative Strength Index (RSI) – momentum oscillator; values above 70 indicate overbought, below 30 oversold.

MACD – difference between short and long exponential moving averages; signals momentum changes.

Bollinger Bands – ±2 standard deviations around a moving average; used for mean‑reversion signals.

Average True Range (ATR) – measures volatility for position sizing.

To compute these indicators:

import requests
import pandas as pd
import ta  # pandas-ta or TA-Lib

# Retrieve spot klines for BTCUSDT on 1h interval (example)
params = {
    'symbol': 'BTCUSDT',
    'interval': '1h',
    'limit': 1000  # maximum allowed
}
resp = requests.get('https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines', params=params)
data = resp.json()

# Convert to DataFrame
columns = ['open_time','open','high','low','close','volume','close_time',
           'quote_asset_volume','number_of_trades','taker_buy_base_volume',
           'taker_buy_quote_volume','ignore']
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=columns)
# Convert prices to numeric
for col in ['open','high','low','close','volume']:
    df[col] = df[col].astype(float)
# Convert timestamps to datetime
df['open_time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['open_time'], unit='ms')

# Compute indicators
df['sma_50'] = df['close'].rolling(window=50).mean()        # 50‑period SMA
df['rsi'] = ta.momentum.rsi(df['close'], window=14)          # RSI
# Additional indicators can be added similarly


This code downloads 1,000 hourly candles for BTC/USDT, converts them to a Pandas DataFrame and computes a 50‑period moving average and 14‑period RSI using pandas‑ta. For futures data, replace the URL with https://fapi.binance.com/fapi/v1/klines and adjust the symbol and interval.

Designing a statistical arbitrage and trend‑following strategy
Statistical arbitrage with futures contracts

Statistical arbitrage typically involves identifying pairs of instruments whose price spreads tend to mean‑revert. In the context of cryptocurrency futures:

Select pairs with strong correlation – for example, BTCUSDT and ETHUSDT perpetual futures. Because futures are margined in USDT, the spread between two contracts may exhibit co‑integration.

Retrieve historical price series – use the futures klines endpoint to download synchronous price series for both contracts (e.g., 1‑minute or 5‑minute candles).

Compute the spread and z‑score – define the spread as log(Price_A) − β × log(Price_B) where β is the hedge ratio (estimated by linear regression). Calculate the z‑score of the spread: (spread − mean(spread)) / std(spread). When the z‑score exceeds a threshold (e.g., > 2 or < −2), open a long/short position expecting mean reversion.

Use funding rates and open interest as filters – the futures API provides mark price and funding rates
developers.binance.com
, open interest
developers.binance.com
 and trader positioning ratios
developers.binance.com
. Avoid trades when funding costs are high or when the market is strongly trending (e.g., high long/short ratio).

Close positions when the z‑score reverts to zero or crosses a profit‑taking threshold.

Binance’s dataset is limited to the last year for some endpoints (e.g., aggregated trades, funding rate history)
developers.binance.com
developers.binance.com
. Maintain local storage for longer backtests.

Trend‑following component

Trend following captures sustained price moves by entering positions in the direction of the trend and holding them. To implement this on Binance data:

Compute long‑term moving averages (e.g., 50‑day and 200‑day) on daily or 4‑hour candles. A moving average crossover (short SMA crossing above long SMA) signals an uptrend; crossing below signals a downtrend.

Confirm with momentum indicators – the RSI or MACD can confirm trend strength. For example, only take long signals if the RSI is above 50 and short signals if it is below 50.

Incorporate open interest and trader ratios – in futures, a rising open interest along with price increases indicates strong trending interest
developers.binance.com
; top trader long/short ratio can show whether professional traders support the trend
developers.binance.com
. Align your trades with these metrics for higher conviction.

Use trailing stop‑losses based on the ATR to exit when the trend reverses or becomes too volatile.

Combining statistical arbitrage and trend following

A robust strategy can blend both approaches:

Trend filter – use long‑term trend following to select markets or directions. For example, trade statistical arbitrage only when the overall market is range‑bound or trending sideways; avoid arbitrage trades during strong directional trends.

Pair selection – choose pairs of futures contracts with similar trends to reduce directional risk. Evaluate the correlation of their trend signals before including them in the arbitrage universe.

Risk management – allocate capital across both strategies; set separate risk budgets. When a pair trade is opened, hedge with trend‑direction futures positions if necessary. Monitor funding rates
developers.binance.com
 and basis
developers.binance.com
 to avoid carrying cost drifts.

Best practices and limitations

Error handling – the API returns HTTP error codes on invalid requests or rate‑limit breaches. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff. Monitor the Retry‑After header for guidance.

Data completeness – some endpoints are limited to the last 30 days (e.g., top trader ratios
developers.binance.com
) or last month (open interest statistics
developers.binance.com
). Archive data locally to build longer histories.

Time zones – always store raw timestamps (milliseconds) and convert to your local time only when displaying data. This prevents confusion when daylight‑saving time changes.

Security – never expose your API secret. Use environment variables or encrypted secrets in your code. For local testing, restrict API keys to read‑only access.

Testnet – Binance provides a testnet for spot and futures with identical API structure. Use testnet endpoints to develop and validate your code before deploying on live funds. For USDⓈ‑M futures testnet, use https://testnet.binancefuture.com (check the official documentation for current domain).

Conclusion

Binance’s spot and futures APIs provide comprehensive market data necessary for quantitative strategies. By integrating the REST endpoints and WebSocket streams with a technical analysis library, you can create a system that:

Downloads OHLCV data via /api/v3/klines or /fapi/v1/klines and computes indicators such as moving averages, RSI and volatility.

Monitors 24‑hour ticker statistics, funding rates, open interest and trader positioning to gauge market sentiment
developers.binance.com
developers.binance.com
developers.binance.com
.

Implements statistical arbitrage by exploiting mean‑reverting spreads between highly correlated futures contracts, while using trend‑following filters to avoid trading during strong directional moves.

Adjusts risk and position sizing based on volatility (ATR) and open interest growth.

By following the guidelines above and using robust coding practices (rate‑limit management, secure key handling), you can harness Binance’s data to design automated strategies that marry short‑term arbitrage with long‑term trend following. Always backtest thoroughly and be mindful of market risks, especially in the volatile cryptocurrency landscape.
